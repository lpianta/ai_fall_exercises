| Day        | Task                       | Description                                                                            |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monday     | **Create dataset**         | With your desktop camera save images with and without mask.                            |
| Tuesday    | **Classification**         | Train a classifier to predict if you are wearing a mask or not.                        |
| Wednesday  | **Bounding Box detection** | Draw a square on your face and put something on top of that (like a hat or glasses).   |
| Thusrday A | **Key point detection**    | Detect (around 20) key points on your face to apply some filter.                       |
| Thusrday B | **Face segmentation**      | Detect pixels of your face and make a green to put any background.                     |
| Friday     | **Presentation**           | Create the presentation, and present at 17:00                                          |


Extra project: You can build a DeepFake to put your facial expressions on other people's faces.
