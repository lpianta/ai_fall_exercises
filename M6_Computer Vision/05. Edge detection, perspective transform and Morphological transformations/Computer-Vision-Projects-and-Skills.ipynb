    "\n",
    "1. Skill 1: How to import, show, crop, save and close an image with OpenCV. Really important to view what you're working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 2: Change color spaces. OpenCV automatically imports images as BGR so it's useful to know how to convert them to other color.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 3: How to draw shapes and write text on images. Really useful for a lot of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 4: How to create overlay between two images.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 5: Work with color spaces, splitting the channel and work individually on each one of them to then merge them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 6: Create a mask for an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 7: Calculate histogram for color space in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 8: Affine transformation. Useful to move and rotate images.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 9: Resize images.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 10: Bitwise operator. Useful when working with more images or different shapes in the same image\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 11: Blurring and sharpening filters. Useful not only for working directly on the image, but as a step for preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 12: Edge detection. As for blurrin filters, they are useful on the image itself and for preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 13: Brightness increases and decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 14: Thresholding images. Really useful for preprocessing and because some functions require thresholded images to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 15: Keyboard, mouse and trackbar callbacks. Useful to test various thing on an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 16: Perspective transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 17: Image pyramids.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 18: Morphological transformation: erosion, dilation, opening and closing can be very useful when preprocessing an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 19: Finding, drawing, sorting and approximating contours.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 20: Template matching. Useful when we have a template to find in another images.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 21: Use of Haar Cascade. Useful when detecting object.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Skill 22: Finding corners.\n",
